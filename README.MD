# MFK2LUA

### How to use MFK2LUA

This is a command-line tool, which can be used when you're rooted at the path MFK2LUA is in.

You need to specify the tool in your terminal like this and a folder you want to batch convert from MFK to LUA:
MFK2LUA.EXE path_of_folder_with_mfk_files_here

It will convert them in a flash, and ask if you'd like to delete the remaining MFK files.

### Note
It can be a bit finicky with the *level* scripts the game uses, if it's breaking your gags, manually go into your *level* script and make sure your Gag Positions  are encased in quotation marks (ie.: Squish should be "Squish" in level.lua).

Regular mission scripts it works great.
